## Summary

This library provides a tool for migrating your postgres-DB within SAPCAP projects. It uses (migra)[https://github.com/djrobstep/migra] for creating an SQL-diff between a reference-DB and the target-DB. Because migra is written in python, this package installs migra via `pip install migra`.

The semantic versioning of this package is following this (guideline)[https://dev.to/kouts/automated-versioning-and-package-publishing-using-github-actions-and-semantic-release-1kce].
